# Undergraduate Study Projects

This respository includes four typical projects I completed during my undergraduate study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## 1. SJTU BBS Search Engine

    ./SJTU BBS Search Engine

To consolidate the knowledge learnt in course **Distributed Programming**, I implemented a local search engine of [SJTU-BBS](http://bbs.sjtu.edu.cn) supported by **Apache Hadoop**.

This search engine includes three parts: one **crawler**, one **segementer** and one **map-reducer**.

This project was developed and tested on **Linux** platform, mainly written in **Java** and **Python**.

## 2. SMALL-C Compiler

    ./Small-C Compiler

According to the normal practice, I built a compiler during the course **Compiler Principles**. This compiler could analyze **Small-C** language (a simplified **C** language with the main syntax left), build the parsing tree, and eventually translate the input code into **LLVM** language.

This compiler based on **Yacc** and **Lex** tools.

This project was developed and tested on **Linux** platform.

## 3. Intrinsic Image

    ./Intrinsic Image

This project is the final project of course **Software Engineering** and **Computer Graphics**.

Takes a series of images of one object, this program could derive its **intrinsic image** (reflectance + shading).

By utilizing **Matlab** and python's library **PyAMG**, the program is mainly written in **Mat** and **Python**.

## 4. Data Structure

    ./Data Structure

During learning **Data Structure**, I built a set of **STL containers** of my own in **CPP**.

These containers include: `ArrayList`, `Deque`, `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, `TreeMap` and `Priority Queue` with their **algorithms** and **iterators**.
